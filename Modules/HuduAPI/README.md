### Version 1.18
Added Support for Hudu 2.1.5.6 and implemented Folders

Added:

	Get-HuduFolders
	New-HuduFolder
	Set-HuduFolder

I have also added some additional helper features for folders

	Get-HuduFolderMap # will return the structure of all folders in your KB
	Get-HuduFolderMap -company_id $company.id # will return the structure of folders under a customer.
	
You can browse to folders with

	(Get-HuduFolderMap).Folder.SubFolder.SubSubFolder

To get a specific subfolder by path or to create it and its parent folders you can pass in an array of strings to Initialize-HuduFolder:

	$Folders = @("Folder","SubFolder","SubSubFolder")
	Initialize-HuduFolder $Folders

Fixed bug in 2.1.5.6 where booleans have been fixed in asset layouts, but legacy text versions no longer work.

### Version 1.17

Fixed rate limiting in PowerShell 5

### Version 1.16

Fixed issues with UTF8 characters. Invalid characters should be stripped and correct characters sent now.

### Version 1.15

More tweaks to work around the json order issue.

### Version 1.14

Fixes for Powershell 7

Hudu has an API bug where JSON needs to be in the correct order. The module works fine with PS5 but Asset fields weren't created in PS7, This version fixes that.

### Version 1.13

Rate Limiting and Version Check

This update adds in handling for Hudu's API rate limiting. It also adds support for the new AppInfo endpoint and will check your version when both BaseURL and API key have been set. It also fixes the Get-HuduCard command.

## Notes

This is an unofficial powershell module to allow access to the Hudu API. I am not associated with Hudu other than as a customer.

The main change is you now need to provide fields to an asset as:

"field_name": "value"

Where field name is the asset layout field name in lower case with spaces converted to _

In the prior version you needed to provide

"asset_layout_field_id": 1

"value": "value"

I have updated my MSP360 script in Github with the changes to work with the latest version. This version is much faster due to the new filtering options and shows the new asset field style needed:

https://github.com/lwhitelock/HuduAutomation/blob/main/Hudu-M365-Sync.ps1


The filter options on get commands are all optional.

For more information on what Hudu provides and expects you can look at https://your.hudu.domain/developer/1.0/

After installing the module you will need to get an api key from https://your.hudu.domain/admin/api_keys

    New-HuduAPIKey "YourKey"

    New-HuduBaseURL "https://your.hudu.domain"
 
    Get-HuduAssets -name "Computer-01" -id 1 -assetlayoutid 1 -companyid 1 
    
    New-HuduAsset -name "Computer-01 - Backup Plan 1" -company_id 10 -asset_layout_id 2 -fields $fields
    $fields = @(
		@{
			plan_name = "Backup Plan1"
		},
		@{
			computer_name = "Computer-01"
		})
    
    Set-HuduAsset -name "Computer-01 - Backup Plan 1" -company_id 10 -asset_layout_id 2 -fields $fields -asset_id 100
